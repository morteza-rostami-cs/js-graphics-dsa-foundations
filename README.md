# 🏗️ JavaScript Graphics DSA Foundations (Phase 0)

> **Goal:** Build a solid foundation in **algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving patterns** — the essential tools for tackling any Codewars, LeetCode, or graphics-based challenge.

This is the **pre-bootcamp phase**. Before diving into daily problem solving and visualization projects, you need the right tools and mental models.

---

## 📅 Structure Overview

**Duration:** ~3–5 days (10–12 hours/day)  
**Goal:** Understand and implement all essential DSA building blocks and problem-solving patterns  
**Stack:** JavaScript (ES6+)

---

## 🧩 Topics & Learning Objectives

### 1. **Core Data Structures**

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked List (singly, doubly)
- Stack & Queue
- Hash Maps / Objects / Sets
- Heaps (min & max)
- Trees (binary, binary search, general)
- Graphs (adjacency list/matrix)
- Matrices & 2D grids

---

### 2. **Essential Algorithms**

- Sorting: bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick
- Searching: linear, binary
- Recursion & backtracking
- Prefix sums / cumulative sums
- Sliding window / two pointers
- Fast exponentiation / modular arithmetic
- BFS & DFS (on tree & graph)
- Greedy & dynamic programming basics

---

### 3. **Problem-Solving Patterns (Essential for 2D Graphics & Simulations)**

1. **Two Pointers** – Scan arrays/strings from both ends or find pairs
2. **Sliding Window** – Handle contiguous subarrays/substrings efficiently
3. **Frequency Counting / Hashing** – Count occurrences with objects, Maps, or Sets
4. **Prefix Sums / Cumulative Sums** – Precompute sums for range queries
5. **Recursion & Backtracking** – Solve complex problems by splitting into subproblems
6. **Divide & Conquer** – Split problem, solve recursively, merge results
7. **Greedy / Optimization Patterns** – Make local optimal choices for global optimum
8. **BFS & DFS / Graph Traversal** – Explore nodes level by level (BFS) or depth first (DFS)
9. **State Machine / Simulation Loops** – Track system or object states over time
10. **Stack / Queue Patterns** – Track history or sequences, useful for undo/redo, trails
11. **Matrix / Grid Patterns** – Navigate 2D arrays systematically (neighbors, diagonals)
12. **Monotonic Stack / Deque** _(Advanced)_ – Efficient next/previous greater/smaller element queries
13. **Bit Manipulation Patterns** _(Optional)_ – Solve problems using bits for sets or masks

## ✅ Checklist

### **Phase 0 – Foundations**

#### Data Structures

- [ ] Implement each DS in JS:
  - Stack, Queue, Linked List
  - HashMap / Set utilities
  - Binary Tree insert/search
  - Matrix helpers

#### Algorithms

- [ ] Implement each algorithm from scratch:
  - Sorting: bubble, merge, quick
  - Searching: linear, binary
  - Recursion: factorial, Fibonacci, tree traversal
  - BFS/DFS

#### Problem-Solving Patterns

- [ ] Implement small JS examples for **each pattern**:
  - Two Pointers → Example: pair sum check
  - Sliding Window → Example: max sum subarray
  - Frequency Counting → Example: most frequent char
  - Prefix Sums → Example: range sum query
  - Recursion & Backtracking → Example: N-Queens
  - Divide & Conquer → Example: merge sort
  - Greedy → Example: interval scheduling
  - BFS & DFS → Example: grid traversal
  - State Machine → Example: particle simulation loop
  - Stack / Queue → Example: balanced parentheses check
  - Matrix / Grid → Example: island counting / flood fill
  - Monotonic Stack → Example: sliding window max
  - Bit Manipulation → Example: subset generation

## 🏗️ Deliverables

- `/data-structures/` → all implemented DS in JS
- `/algorithms/` → sorting, searching, recursion, BFS/DFS, etc.
- `/patterns/` → mini JS snippets demonstrating each pattern
- `/tests/` → small console or canvas demos for each pattern
- `/notes/phase0-foundations.md` → reflections + mental models

---

### 🕒 Estimated Duration

3–5 days, depending on pace.  
Goal: finish **Phase 0 fully confident**, then move into Phase 1: **DSA & Codewars Bootcamp**.
